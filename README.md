# Mental-Health-Prediction
To predict whether the person is suffering from Mental health or not.

Due to lack of awareness mental health issues are neglected and never really cured and prioritized like other physical diseases such as cough, flu etc. Mental health deals with our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It involves our reactions, behavior, feelings, dealings with others. It is difficult to predict mental health.

Introduction
Technology is evolving round the clock in recent times. This has resulted in job opportunities for people all around the world. It comes with a hectic schedule that can be detrimental to people’s mental health. So mental health has been one of the most prominent issues, with stress, loneliness, and depression all on the rise over the last year. Diagnosing mental health is difficult because people aren’t always willing to talk about their problems.
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that is mostly used nowadays. ML is becoming more capable for disease diagnosis and also provides a platform for doctors to analyze a large number of patient data and create personalized treatment according to the patient’s medical situation

Machine Learning model to predict mental health 
For predicting mental health we use six algorithms of  machine learning
1.	Logistic Regression
2.	KNN Classifier
3.	Decision Tree Classifier
4.	Random Forest Classifier
5.	Ada Boost Classifier
6.	Gradient Boosting Classifier
   
So, we get the best accuracy from Ada Boost algorithm
Logistic regression
Score is :0.848
KNN Classifier
Score is :0.776
Decision Tree Classifier
Score is :0.7946666666666666
Random Forest Classifier
Score is :0.8346666666666667
Ada Boost Classifier
Score is :0.864
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Score is :0.837333333333333
